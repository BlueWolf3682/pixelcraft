Coal compresser:
Eventualy the bots had found out that it had many metals in it, even the valued thorium that kept their reactors fueled. For now, they tried to figure out how to extract the metals directly. Nothing they tried worked.  One of the bots decided to melt the scrap. They said that the idea was pointless, as these were ancient fossils which they were studying. The bot's name was dart. They were banished to the farlands and told never to come back again, with threats to be shot on sight.
