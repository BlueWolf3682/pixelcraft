The lore (In order of events)

Stone
Surprisingly, each universe incarnation might be different from the last one in not just it's formation, but it's rules. Apparently in this iteration, radioactive materials take an extremely short time to react as processes down at the quantum level are sped up. How do we know this? The last iteration had left behind indestructible information before it was reborn. Information on how nuclear reactions worked. There was one exception that exists however. In the stone of planets, there remains a glowing property. Radioactive materiels in the stone of each planet decaying extremely slowly. We are able to see at night because of this. It emits enough light to dimly light up the surface of many planets. The light is on the lower end of the spectrum, still on the visible portion making it usable for a light source deep in space. This was normal to us. The glowing stone was a blessing to have and we valued it until we found better ways of lighting up our encampments.

Templura 

Taconite Pulveriser:
During the volitile stage of the universe, Templura and Serpulo, fated to meet, crashed into eachother with such force, the shockwave blew away the other planets in the system. The remains of Templura formed a small rocky planet while Sepulo, barely held together after the impact slowly reformed into a new world. Now it's ours. Come, our work is not done yet.

Ioniser:
However, there was a small problem with the formation of the planets. Held together by nothing but gravity, Templura's surface was jagged, unlike other planets which looked rounded, almost perfectly spherical.

Sand Reversal Unit:
Serpulo's surface was cooling down. It had a magnetic field caused by the swirling of molten metal at the planet's core, protecting gasses from intense solar winds. However, as there was high volcanic activity, the surface never formed an ocean. There were isolated pockets of water on it but no grand seas for sailors to explore.

life

Catapult:
Life on Serpulo was harsh after the inccident of the first mass extinction. Nothing could survive. Or so we thought.

Trebuche:
There was ife flourishing under the sea around geothermal vents. They were not of normal lifeforms, being fish who's scales were as dense as metal.

Cannon:
Eventualy, after a few hundred years or so, life adapted to the surface's conditions. Not biological life, but mechanical life.

Howitzer:
Mechs which resembled inscects, fish, birds and mroe were formed.

Core Beacon
Years ago, a great flood overwhelmed Serpulo and rusted the grounds. 1000 years later when ai regained footing.  

Rusty Core
The prediscessor of this core was found and quickely scaned for it's structural integrety. It was found to be broken but blueprints were recovered. 

Rusty Alpha:
After it was found, the slag wars began. What was once a peacefull world had volcanoes errupt all over the world and requried help.
Rusty Delta:
Some bots went rogue. Others helped their relatives for they knew if their type had vanished, all the hope left for their kind would be restoration.

slag

Volitile generator:
When the bots first discovered scrap, they were scared for as there was scrap, something had happened.

Coal compresser:
Eventualy the bots had found out that it had many metals in it, even the valued thorium that kept their reactors fueled. For now, they tried to figure out how to extract the metals directly. Nothing they tried worked.  One of the bots decided to melt the scrap. They said that the idea was pointless, as these were ancient fossils which they were studying. The bot's name was dart. They were banished to the farlands and told never to come back again, with threats to be shot on sight.

Dunescape crags

Lava cannels run underground
A smell of char lingers...
The diralect used a superweapon here
The usage of it brought downfall to their conquest to concour the planet
now all that remains is their tech
